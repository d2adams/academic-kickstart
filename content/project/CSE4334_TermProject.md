The most compelling reason why people would want this app is new and old experiences.  By having an easy method to find similar music they can expand their horizon finding more music they enjoy, or find old music they enjoyed but forgot the name.  This will also allow them to explore new types of music by seeing what is popular and recommended in a different genre.  As music has a large impact on people's emotions, this will allow them to find music for all moods.  This app is particularly useful as it displays the types of music based on the genres and the total number of people that follow the artists of that genre which cuts out some of the bias that big apps have toward mainstream artists.  In the end, this app will allow users to explore and find music in an easy and convenient manner.
