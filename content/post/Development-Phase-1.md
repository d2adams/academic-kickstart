summary = "The basic parts of the Music Recommender app and search feature have been implemented; however with some issues. 
+++
The Music recommender app uses SVM to parse through the artist names and matches the query with the most similar result.  This is done to bring up results even if the user misspells the artist name or does not know the exact name of the artist.  Unfortunatly, the app does not get past the search feature as the code for the SVM causes an blocking error when trying to parse through all of the data.
